# The goal of this assignment is to learn about the kNN.
- We will use IRIS dataset. https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris
- Divide the dataset as development and test. Because kNN does not require training you donâ€™t have a train dataset. Make sure to randomly divide the dataset.
- Implement kNN using the following hyperparameters
  - Number of neighbor K = 1,3,5,7
  - distance metric = euclidean distance, normalized euclidean distance, cosine similarity
- Using the development dataset:
  - Calculate accuracy by iterating all of the development data point
  - Find optimal hyperparameters
    - Draw bar charts for accuracy
- Using the test dataset
  - Use the optimal hyperparameters you found in the step c, and use it to calculate the final accuracy.
